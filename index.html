    <h1>Hello👋🏻</h1>
    <h2>My name is Cassie.</h2>
    <p class=”paragraph”>I currently work as an Exhibitions Assistant and Social Media Manager for an arts-based non-profit organization in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida">Sarasota, FL</a>.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I’m pursuing a Master's Degree in Web Design but my background is rooted in old-school print media. I graduated from FSU in 2019 with a degree in Studio Art focusing on Printmaking & Book Arts.</p>
    <h3>In my free time I enjoy:</h3>
    <ul id="myHobbies">
        <li class="hobby">Reading</li>
        <li class="hobby">Drawing</li>
        <li class="hobby">Spending time with friends & family</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My main career goals are to:</h3>
    <ul id="careerGoals">
        <li class="goal">Earn my Master's Degree.</li>
        <li class="goal">Gain enough confidence to take on freelance work.</li>
        <li class="goal">Land a creative career that allows me to have more control over my schedule.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m excited for this program because I hope to have my own business as graphic & web designer one day.</p>
    <p>But realistically, Greta will always wear the pants around here.</p>
